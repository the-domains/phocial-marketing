  changing enhancement enabled our mobile photographers to instinctively choose
  the best orientation and graphic layout for the photo without any manual
  changes or wasted time.  Responsive Layouts ensure a higher quality and more
  shareable take away for event guests, without sacrificing branding
  opportunities for Phocial clients.



  The added flexibility resulted in a 90% increase in micro site photo views and
  a worldwide reach of visitors from 53 countries vs. the prior years activation
  at the 55th GRAMMY Awards.



  Responsive Layouts are perfect for Red Carpet Step and Repeat events, capturing
  both large groups and that stunning head to toe shot of that special
  dress.  Athlete Meet & Greets or any other event where a significant height
  difference occurs between guests and talent.  At concerts, this allows Phocial
  to capture the perfect balance of guests and stage/lighting giving the photo
  a true feel for the entire experience.  The added ability to capture event
  signage behind guests, perfect for wine and food festivals.
