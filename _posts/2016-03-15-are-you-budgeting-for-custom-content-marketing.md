# Are You Budgeting For Custom Content Marketing?

First, lets start off with the question of What exactly is Custom Content Marketing? 

Simply put, [Custom Content Marketing][0] involves the creation and sharing of media and/or content in order to acquire customers. This information can be presented in a variety of formats, including news, video, white papers, e-books, infographics, case studies, how-to guides, question and answer articles, or Phocial's favorite and specialty, photos. Content marketing is focused not on selling, but on simply communicating with customers and prospects. The idea is to inspire business and loyalty. 

Next, lets look at what brands and their CMO's are looking for.
